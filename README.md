# DataOps 

A curated list of products, frameworks or tools pertaining to Cloud Native Data Management. 

Each of the category in turn lists the self managed and cloud managed tools. 

- [Data Pipeline Orchestrators](./data-pipelines.md)
- [Data Warehouses](./data-warehouses.md)
- [SQL Databases](./databases-sql.md)
- [NoSQL Databases](./databases-nosql.md)
- [Object Storage](./databases-objectstorage.md)
- [Streaming](./streaming.md)

Its pretty hard to categorize the tools, especially when they can provide multiple aspects of data management. Always looking for feedback to make the above categorization better. Please feel free to [raise an PR](https://github.com/oss-bootcamp/dataops/pulls) with your recommended changes or [raise an issue](https://github.com/oss-bootcamp/dataops/issues/new) describing the change.
